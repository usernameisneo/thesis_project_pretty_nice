Project Phoenix: A Strategic and Phased Execution Blueprint
This revised blueprint reorganizes your 55 features into a strategically sound, five-phase plan. It begins with a foundational, minimal-risk "Phase 0" to establish a working core, followed by iterative phases that layer on functionality in a logical, dependency-aware sequence. This approach is designed to produce tangible results quickly and build a stable platform for your ultimate vision.

Phase 0: The Core Pipeline (The "It Works" Milestone)
Primary Goal: To definitively overcome the "no success so far" hurdle by building the absolute essential data pipeline. This phase proves the core concept is viable by creating a functional, albeit minimal, backend and a simple command-line interface (CLI) for interaction. This is the non-negotiable foundation upon which everything else is built.

Architectural Foundation:

Feature #2: Modular Architecture: Design the system from day one with clear separation of concerns (e.g., Ingestion Service, Indexing Service, Search Service).
Feature #4: Data Flow Pipeline: Implement the foundational data flow: Ingestion -> Processing -> Indexing -> Search.
Feature #51: Core Technology Stack: Solidify the choice of Python, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, etc. .
Feature #47: Full-Featured Command-Line Interface (CLI): The CLI will be the primary interface for this phase, allowing for direct interaction with the core pipeline for testing and validation .
Core Feature Implementation:

Ingestion & Processing:
Feature #7: Multi-format PDF Extraction: Implement the core PDF text extraction .
Feature #11: Intelligent Text Chunking: Segment the extracted text into meaningful semantic chunks .
Indexing & Search:
Feature #15: Vector Embeddings: Generate vector representations of the text chunks .
Feature #17: FAISS Vector Database: Implement the FAISS index for high-performance similarity search .
Feature #19: Hybrid Search Engine (Basic): Create a basic search function combining keyword and semantic search .
Outcome of Phase 0: A developer can use the CLI to point the system at a directory of PDFs. The system will ingest, process, and index them. The developer can then perform a basic search via the CLI and get back a list of relevant text chunks. This provides a tangible, working asset and validates the most critical technical components.

Phase 1: The Research Hub (GUI and Foundational AI)
Primary Goal: To build the user-facing application on top of the validated core pipeline. This phase introduces the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the first layer of user-centric AI features, transforming the backend engine into a usable research tool.
